      desc: "As a boy living in Nigeria I had uncles that weren't my uncles, aunties that I shared no blood relations with mother around that would treat me like their own. They were gathering and meetings at our next-door kiosk, shop, damn even under a tree, people in the community knew one another, looked out for one another, and took care of one another, the importance of community was something I never had to ponder upon until I moved here. Different Perspective, See the US is very different, you might ask how Aaron, Well I will tell you, compared to Nigeria, the US has a very individualist way of being, you look out for yourself and your family, and the domination of which you can do that is somehow connected to the system. See there are no more third places, no random kiosks, or no community trees for people to stay a community at. People's jobs stake most of their time and believe it or not they don't get holidays off. In fact, on most holidays they would work. Full Picture, But really in the full picture of it all, Nigeria didn't have as many resources, opportunities, and safety, so I guess you lose some and win some, I think the blessings come from finding the middle between an individualist mindset and a community-based one, benign the best version of yourself so that it not only benefits you and your community as well.

      desc: "The severity of life doesn't start to kick in until you are older, you know as a kid throughout your teens you are very impressionable, and you start to decide what is important to you through the influence of your parents and environment. You might have stolen, cheated, engaged in activities you didn't feel right in made some mistakes and by the time you are older you might start to have regrets and condemn yourself for your past. Luckily enough for us, we have Jesus, He is our redeemer, He does not condemn us, he delivers us, and puts us onto the path of righteousness, He comes and lets us know that we are worthy of His love and we are worthy of Godly love. He lets us know that we can be redeemed, forgiven, and transformed.The good news is that Jesus is for everyone, He is always knocking and always ready to give love. Take it from a personal testimony, Iâ€™ve only come to love myself after I accepted Jesus and He is constantly transforming me and if He can transform me He can transform you!",
